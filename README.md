A search for the unicorns in the wild universe of SumUp

## Stack

This project was bootstrapped from the [`next-firebase-auth`](https://github.com/gladly-team/next-firebase-auth/tree/main/example) example.

It uses:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): a React-based frontend framework
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): auth, data persistence
- [Circuit UI](https://circuit.sumup.com): SumUp's component library

## Setup

You will need to add the required environment variables to a `.env.local` file for local developmentâ€“see `.env.local.example`.
